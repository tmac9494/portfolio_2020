          <p>In 2014 I began my path in web development and chose at the time to focus on one Javascript Framework, React. I now consider myself a React specialist and most of my skills reflect that.</p>
          <p>While engineering is a strong passion for me, design is equally so. I do not have as much professional training and experience in design but it is an aspect of my work that has always come very natural to me. I believe a lot of it is due to my extensive involvment in the arts when I was young and it has been a key difference maker in my career.</p>
