          <p>
            In 2014 I began my path in web development and chose at the time to
            focus on one Javascript Framework, React. I now consider myself a
            React specialist and most of my skills reflect that.
          </p>

            While engineering is a strong passion for me, design is equally so.
            I do not have as much professional training and experience in design
            but it is an aspect of my work that has always come very natural to
            me. I believe a lot of it is due to my extensive involvment in the
            arts when I was young and it has been a key difference maker in my
            career.
