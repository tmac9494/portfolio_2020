      "That same teacher told me later in life she’d never met a high school student that thought so much about his future. Her comment came from my decision to pursue Electrical Engineering instead of following art like most of my AP Art peers. The 2008 Financial Crisis took a toll on my family and job security was the most important thing for me at that time.",

I enjoyed a lot of it, made many friends and connections through the Greek organizations and learned some useful things. I also got a part-time job through a new friend delivering mattresses at this time.",
      "The problem came from a complete emptiness and lack of drive that I couldn’t place at the time. Later in life, reflecting on that time; it was clear that losing all the passionate work in my life and trying to force myself to learn stuff that I wasn’t interested in was excruciatingly difficult for me.",
      "I dropped out two years in with a below average GPA and feeling defeated. My brain could not handle a fourteenth year of English class and filter classes full of paperwork. I felt terrible shame and lost a lot of confidence. For the first time, the plan in my head started to fall apart.",

She’s been here for all of it. We were high school sweethearts and I wanted to marry her, but my current income was not enough. I was not proud of my job and I knew I was capable of more, so I began considering welding as a profession. I would get a creative outlet and it’s a reliable trade.",
      "While researching online side jobs to help save money for welding school, I stumbled across the term “web developer” for the first time. After seeing the job market for this field in the US labor statistics and learning that you could teach yourself I was sold. I began spending every minute of the workday learning to code. Only taking a break when customers came in with questions.",
      "The first night after I discovered this I spent all night talking to Haley about it, feeling sure I had found what I was meant to do. See, something big happened at this time; the passion I always had for Art and need for creativity drove my learning and was an asset instead of a hindrance. I wanted to learn as much as I could because every style property and animation was another tool to create UI, to create Art. I fell in love with learning and began to learn more than just code, I developed an insatiable appetite for knowledge. Physics, politics, psychology I just wanted to constantly learn new things. It really was my own personal renaissance.",

This was my plan and I got 3 websites done for local business to put together a half-decent portfolio. I look back on this time with immense pride in my attitude and tenacity.",
      "One fateful day I was sitting behind the desk at the mattress store continuing my JavaScript learning when a woman came in looking for a mattress. Mrs. Wendy would turn out to be a Senior Web Developer and recently started a local marketing firm with a business partner. I sold her a mattress and she offered me a job.",
      "I met an amazing coworker while working with Mrs. Wendy and finally had a year of experience under my belt. The Marketing firm was not working out and would shut down soon. Long story short I convinced my old boss from the mattress store to fund a small web development firm of our own. The owner – Mr. Mike became a mentor in business and productivity and I gained a lot of experience getting requirements and feedback from many different customers in various industries.",
      "I also convinced Mr. Mike to pay for a Technical Degree through teamtreehouse.com at this time as well. He was paying $500 a month in marketing/graphic design services at the mattress store that I would manage for free if he could pay the high monthly fee on the Tech Degree.",
      "Mr. Mike would have personal tragedies that required him to turn his attention to his family. I would go on to take a job with a fantastic marketing firm by the name of Southern View Media.",

      "I outgrew Southern View Media but left on good terms with fond memories. I got a lot of great experience coaching junior developers, working with designers, and got featured in a local magazine as one of the 50 most interesting. ",
      "I wanted to pursue full time application work and move away from traditional websites to grow my career and continue down the planned path. I got a job at Standard Furniture and was initially hired to work on the new ecommerce platform. We ended up outsourcing that work mostly and I took more of an advisory role. Feeling restless and seeing the need for solutions during this transition period in the company, I began developing applications on the internal network to solve business problems. ",
      "I was the only real web developer at the company and there was no Engineering team. These applications came from people in the company needing solutions and my hunger to be better. I was in over my head with no support outside of the teams using the apps and the ecommerce team - the pit in the stomach. I was pumping out tons of rough code but getting nothing but good feedback from the departments in the company. I went from only understanding godaddy servers to solely managing/designing/developing 3 applications on the company intranet. I would be the last one there every day scribbling on white boards and typing away - the race in the heart.",
      "This combination of fear and passion created a rate of learning I haven't matched since. In one year I went from a good front end web developer to understanding web sockets, server management, api integrations, how to communicate to stakeholders, and what it feels like to have a team where everyone is passionate about what you're doing.",
      "I didn’t have any coders to help me at that time but I did  have an amazing coworker by the name of Tom Ascher. He always said he couldn’t write code but he could read it. Together we were unstoppable. Tom would feed off of my passion for the applications and effectively communicate to higher ups the development goals and progress.",
